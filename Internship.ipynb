The first program to write is the same for all languages: Print the words hello, world This is a big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. With these mechanical details mastered, everything else is comparatively easy. In C, the program to print ``hello, world'' is #include <stdio.h> main() { printf(\\\"hello, world\\n\\\");} Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ``.c'', such as hello.c, then compile it with the command cc hello.c\""

            " file copying Given getchar and putchar, you can write a surprising amount of useful code without knowing anything more about input and output. the simplest example is a program that copies its input to its output one character at a time. a character on the keyboard or screen is stored internally just as a bit pattern. the type char is specifically meant for storing such character data. but any integer type can be used. the program for copying would be written more concisely by experienced C programmers. any assignment, such as c = getchar(), is an expression and has a value, which is the value of the left hand side after the assignment. this means that a assignment can appear as part of a larger expression. main()  int c; while ((c = getchar()) putchar(c);  The while gets a character, assigns it to c. if it was not, the body of the while is executed, printing the character. main - there is now only one reference to getchar - shrinks the program. c = getchar()!= EOF is equivalent to c = (getchar()!= EOF) this has the undesired effect of setting c to 0 or 1 depending on whether or not the call of getchar returned end of file.\n",

'A' is a character constant; in the ASCII character set its value is 65, the internal representation of the character A.

            " The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages: Print the words hello, world. Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system, print the words \"hello, world\" C programs are written in the C programming language. To compile a C program, you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ``c'', such as hello.c. If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a character or misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently. The first line of the program, #include <stdio.h> tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library. The standard library is described in  ARTICLE 7 and Appendix B. One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values. summarize: nts, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list. In this example, main is defined to be a function that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list ( ). #include <stdio.h> includes information about standard library functions. The first C program contains only one statement, \"hello, world\\n\" The sequence \\n in the string is C notation for the newline character, w. A sequence of characters in double quotes is called a character string. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for printf and other functions. If you leave out the \\n (a worthwhile experiment), you will find that there is no line advance after the output is printed. You must use \\n to include a newline character in the printf argument. Several calls may be used to build up an output line. An escape sequence like \\n provides a general and extensib. C provides a mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. Among the others that C provides are \\t for tab, \\b for backspace, \\\" for the double quote and \\\\ for the backslash itself. There is a complete list in Section 2.3.\n",

            " The program itself still consists of the definition of a single function named main. It is longer than the one that printed ``hello, world'', but not complicated. It introduces several new ideas, including comments, variables, arithmetic expressions, loops, and formatted output. summarize:, upper, step; /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */ fahr = 0, 20,..., 300; step = 20; /* step size */ lower = 0; upper = 300; /* lower limit of temperature scale */ lower * (fahr-32) / 9; /* upper limit */ lower + step; lower + celsius; lower - celsius. The type int means that the variables listed are integers; by contrast with float, which means floating point. The range of both int and float depends on the machine you are using. 16-bits ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit ints. A float number is typically a 32- bit quantity, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10-38. summarize: float, including:  char   character - a single byte. There are also arrays, structures and unions of these basic types, pointers to them, and functions that return them. Individual statements are terminated by semicolons. The size of these objects is also machine-dependent. The while loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. If it is true, the body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces) is executed. When the test becomes false (fahr exceeds upper) the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows. In indentation and spacing are critical in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using blanks around operators to clarify grouping. The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently. summarize: celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;. The reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 is that in C, as in many other languages, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded. Since 5 and 9 are integers, 5/9 would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures would be reported as zero. summarize: %d\\t%d\\n\", fahr, celsius);.http://freebooks.by.ru/view/CProgrammingLanguage/ chapter1.html (6 of 30) Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction. There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is that the output isn't very pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if we augment each %d in the printf statement with a width, the numbers printed will be right- justified in their fields. summarize:  digits wide, and the second in a field six digits wide. Because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very accurate. To get more accurate answers, we should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer. This requires some changes in the program. This is much the same as before, except that fahr and celsius are declared to be float. We were unable to use 5/9 in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is floating point, so 5.0/9.0 is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values. summarize: nteger operation is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. If we had written (fahr-32), the 32 would be automatically converted tofloating point. %6.1f describes another number (celsius) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. width and precision may be omitted from a specification. %6d  print as decimal integer, at leas  20 characters wide. Among others, printf also recognizes %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, %c for character, %s for character                 string and %% for itself.summarize: t 6 characters wide                 %f  print as floating point                 %6.2f   print  floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point.\n",

The expression that computes the Celsius temperature now appears as the third argument of printf instead of a separate assignment statement. The for statement is a loop, a generalization of the while. Within the parentheses, there are three parts, separated by semicolons. The first part, the initialization, is done once, before the loop proper is entered. The second part is the test or condition that controls the The body of the loop can be a single statement or a group of statements enclosed in braces. The choice between while and for is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer. The for is usually appropriate in loops in which the initialization and increment are single statements and logically related. summarize: version program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.1.4. version of the program that prints the table is used to print it in the reverse order of the degree of the sun.\n",

Text input or output, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to, is dealt with as streams of characters. A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character. The function getchar reads the next input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. The function putchar prints a character each time it is called. Calls to putchar and printf  may be interleaved; the output will appear in the order in which the calls are made.\n",

            " summarize: File CopyingGiven getchar and putchar, you can write a surprising amount of useful code without knowing anything more about input and output. The simplest example is a program that copies its input to its output one character at a time. The relational operator!= means ``not equal to''. The problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The type char is specifically meant for storing such character data, but any integer type can be used. The solution is that getchar returns a distinctive value when there is no more input, a value that cannot be confused with any real character. This value is called  grotesqueEOF, for 'end of file' The program for copying would be written more concisely by experienced C programmers. In C, any assignment is an expression and has a value, which is the value of the left hand side after the assignment. If the assignment of a character to c is put inside the test part of a while loop, the copy program can be written this way. The while gets a character, assigns it to c, and then tests whether the character was the end-of-file signal. If it is not, the body of the while is executed, printing the character. The while then repeats. When the end of the input is finally reached, the while terminates and so does main. The precedence of!= is higher than that of =. In the absence of parentheses the relational test!= would be done before the assignment =. This has the undesired effect of setting c to 0 or 1, depending on whether or not the call of getchar returned end end.\n",

On some machines, int and long are the same size, on others an int is 16 bits, with a maximum value of 32767. We will also use a for statement instead of a while, to illustrate another way to write the loop. The body of this for loop is empty, because all the work is done in the test and increment parts. But the grammatical rules of C require that a for statement have a body. The isolated semicolon, called a null statement, is there to satisfy that requirement. We put it on a separate line to make it visible. summarize:  things about while and for is that they test at the top of the loop, before proceeding with the body. If there is nothing to do, nothing is done, even if that means never going through the loop body.Programs should act intelligently when given zero-length input.

This is artificial, but it permits us to illustrate several aspects of C in one program. There are twelve categories of input, so it is convenient to use an array. Here is one version of the program:  #include <stdio.h> summarize:    while ((c = getchar())!= EOF) ++ndigit[c-'0']; ++nwhite; ++nother; printf(\"digits =\"); for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ndigit[i] = digits, white space = 123, other = 345. summarize: n, which includes integer variables like i, and integer constants.

If it is, the numeric value of that digit is c - '0.' summarize: en 0 and 9 corresponding to the character '0' to '9' stored in c, and thus a valid subscript for the array ndigit.

            " In C, a function is equivalent to a subroutine or function in Fortran. A function provides a convenient way to encapsulate some computation. With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore how a job is done. Since C has no exponentiation operator like the ** of Fortran, let us illustrate the mechanics of function definit. Summarize: ion by writing a function power(m,n) to raise an integer m to a positive integer power n. That is, the value of power(2,5) is 32. This function is not a practical exponentiation routine, since it handles only positive powers of small integers. summarize:   p = 1; for (i = 1, n = n; ++i) p = p * base;    return p; - p; --p; -n; -p; return p. C programming language is written in C, a programming language. Each call passes two arguments to power, which each time returns an integer to be formatted and printed. In an expression, power(2,i) is an integer just as 2 and i are. The names used by power for its parameters are local to power and are not visible to any other function. summarize: nerally use parameter for a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function. The value that power computes is returned to main by the return: statement. A return statement with no expression causes control, but no useful value, to be returned to the caller. The declaration just before main says that power is a function that expects two int arguments and returns an int. This declaration has to agree with the definition and uses of power. Non-zero values signal unusual or erroneous termination conditions. In the interests of simplicity, we have omitted return statements from our main functions up to this point. The biggest change between ANSI C and earlier versions is how functions are declared and defined. In the original definition of C, the power function would have been written like this:  /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */ (old-style version) The new syntax of function prototypes makes it much easier for a compiler to detect errors in the number of arguments or their types. The old style of declaration and definition s has been omitted. The new style of definition and declaration s is much easier to understand and understand. Summarize: till works in ANSI C, at least for a transition period. We strongly recommend that you use the new form when you have a compiler that supports it. Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function for conversion.\n",

            "Arguments - Call by Value\n",
            " --------------------------------------------  \n",
            " In C, all function arguments are passed ``by value'' This means that the called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables rather than the originals. This leads to more compact programs with fewer extraneous variables. Call by value is an asset, however, not a liability. The parameter n is used as a temporary variable, and is counted down (a for loop that runs backwards) until it becomes zero. Whatever is done to n inside power has no effect on the argument that power was originally called with. The caller must provide the address of the variable to be set (technically a pointer to the variable) and the called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer and access the va. The story is different for arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array. There is no copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any argument. This is the topic of the next section.\n",

            "Character Arrays\n",
            " --------------------------------------------  \n",
            " The most common type of array in C is the array of characters. To illustrate the use of character arrays, let's write a program that reads a set of text lines and prints the longest. One piece gets a new line, another saves it, and the rest controls the process. When we find a line that is longer than the previous longest line, it must be saved somewhere. This suggests a  second function, copy, to copy the new line to a safe place. Here is a main program to control getline and copy. The result is a program that prints the longest line. Summarize: input line. If (max > 0) /* there was a line */ printf(\"%s\", longest); return 0;   } /* getline:  read a line into s, return length  */ int getline(char s[],int lim)   { for (i=0; i < lim-1 && (c=getchar())!=EOF) i; c; ++i; ++c; } The functions getline and copy are declared at the beginning of the program. They communicate through a pair of arguments and a returned value. In getline, the first argument is an array, and the second, lim, is an integer. The purpose of supplying the size of an array in a declaration is to set aside stor The length of an array s is not necessary in getline since its size is set in main. getline uses return to send a value back to the caller, just as the function power did. This line also declares that getline returns an int; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted. summarize: sed by the C language. When a string constant  like  \"hello\\n\"appears in a C program, it is stored as an array of characters containing the characters in the string and terminated with a '0' to mark the end. Main can determine whether the line was too long, and then cope as it wishes. There is no way for a user of getline to know in advance how long an input line might be, so getline checks for overflow. The user of copy already knows (or can find out) how big the strings are. Exercise 1-19. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s. Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at a time.summarize: e entirely blank lines. Exercises 1-10.\n",

            "External Variables and Scope\n",
            " --------------------------------------------  \n",
            " The variables in main, such as line, longest, etc., are private or local to main. Because they are declared within main, no other function can have direct access to them. This is why such variables are usually known as automatic variables, following terminology in other languages. We will use the term automatic henceforth to refer to these local variables. Because automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not retain their values from one call to the next. As an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are external to all functions. Because external variables are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to communicate data between functions. An external variable must be defined, exactly once, outside of any function. The variable must also be declared in each function that wants to access it. To make the discussion concrete, let us rewrite the longest-line program with line, longest, and max as external variables. This requires changing the calls, declarations, and bodies of all three functions. Summarize: so far */ char line[MAXLINE];    /* current input line */   char longest[MAXLine];  /* longest line saved here */  int getline(void); void copy( void); /* print longest input line; specialized version */ main() { int len; int max; extern char longest; return 0;   } The external variables in main, getline and copy are defined by the first lines of the example above. Syntactically, external definitions are just like definitions of local variables, but since they occur outside of functions, they are external. Before a function can use an external variable, the name of the variable must be made known to t. In certain circumstances, the extern declaration can be omitted. If the definition of the external variable occurs in the source file before its use in a particular function, then there is no need for a declaration in the function. The extern declarations in main, getline and copy are thus redundant. N declarations of variables and functions in a separate file, historically called a header, that is included by #include at the front of each source file. The functions of the standard library, for example, are declared in headers like <stdio.h>. This topic is discussed at length in Chapter 4, and the library itself in Chapter 7 and Appendix B. summarize: ration, and turns off all argument list checking; the word void must be used for an explicitly empty list. We will discuss this further in Chapter 4. You should note that we are using the words definition and declaration carefully when we refer to external variables. Summarize: aught with peril since it leads to programs whose data connections are not all obvious. Second version of the longest-line program is inferior to the first, partly for these reasons, and partly because it destroys the generality of two useful functions by writing into them the names of the variables they manipulate. summarize: e a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter? Exercise 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings  and character constants properly. C comments don't nest. Exercises 1-24. Check a program for rudimentary syntax errors like unmatched parentheses, brackets and braces.\n",

            "BART Summary: The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages: Print the words hello, world. Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system, print the words \"hello, world\" C programs are written in the C programming language. To compile a C program, you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ``c'', such as hello.c. If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a character or misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently. The first line of the program, #include <stdio.h> tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library. The standard library is described in  ARTICLE 7 and Appendix B. One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values. summarize: nts, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list. In this example, main is defined to be a function that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list ( ). #include <stdio.h> includes information about standard library functions. The first C program contains only one statement, \"hello, world\\n\" The sequence \\n in the string is C notation for the newline character, w. A sequence of characters in double quotes is called a character string. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for printf and other functions. If you leave out the \\n (a worthwhile experiment), you will find that there is no line advance after the output is printed. You must use \\n to include a newline character in the printf argument. Several calls may be used to build up an output line. An escape sequence like \\n provides a general and extensib. C provides a mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. Among the others that C provides are \\t for tab, \\b for backspace, \\\" for the double quote and \\\\ for the backslash itself. There is a complete list in Section 2.3.\n",

            "BART Summary: The program itself still consists of the definition of a single function named main. It is longer than the one that printed ``hello, world'', but not complicated. It introduces several new ideas, including comments, variables, arithmetic expressions, loops, and formatted output. summarize:, upper, step; /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */ fahr = 0, 20,..., 300; step = 20; /* step size */ lower = 0; upper = 300; /* lower limit of temperature scale */ lower * (fahr-32) / 9; /* upper limit */ lower + step; lower + celsius; lower - celsius. The type int means that the variables listed are integers; by contrast with float, which means floating point. The range of both int and float depends on the machine you are using. 16-bits ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit ints. A float number is typically a 32- bit quantity, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10-38. summarize: float, including:  char   character - a single byte. There are also arrays, structures and unions of these basic types, pointers to them, and functions that return them. Individual statements are terminated by semicolons. The size of these objects is also machine-dependent. The while loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. If it is true, the body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces) is executed. When the test becomes false (fahr exceeds upper) the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows. In indentation and spacing are critical in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using blanks around operators to clarify grouping. The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently. summarize: celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;. The reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 is that in C, as in many other languages, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded. Since 5 and 9 are integers, 5/9 would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures would be reported as zero. summarize: %d\\t%d\\n\", fahr, celsius);.http://freebooks.by.ru/view/CProgrammingLanguage/ chapter1.html (6 of 30) Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction. There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is that the output isn't very pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if we augment each %d in the printf statement with a width, the numbers printed will be right- justified in their fields. summarize:  digits wide, and the second in a field six digits wide. Because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very accurate. To get more accurate answers, we should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer. This requires some changes in the program. This is much the same as before, except that fahr and celsius are declared to be float. We were unable to use 5/9 in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is floating point, so 5.0/9.0 is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values. summarize: nteger operation is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. If we had written (fahr-32), the 32 would be automatically converted tofloating point. %6.1f describes another number (celsius) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. width and precision may be omitted from a specification. %6d  print as decimal integer, at leas  20 characters wide. Among others, printf also recognizes %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, %c for character, %s for character                 string and %% for itself.summarize: t 6 characters wide                 %f  print as floating point                 %6.2f   print  floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point.\n",

The for statement is a loop, a generalization of the while. Within the parentheses, there are three parts, separated by semicolons. The first part, the initialization, is done once, before the loop proper is entered. The second part is the test or condition that controls the The body of the loop can be a single statement or a group of statements enclosed in braces. The choice between while and for is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer. The for is usually appropriate in loops in which the initialization and increment are single statements and logically related. summarize: version program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.1.4. version of the program that prints the table is used to print it in the reverse order of the degree of the sun.\n",

Text input or output, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to, is dealt with as streams of characters. A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character. The function getchar reads the next input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. The function putchar prints a character each time it is called. Calls to putchar and printf  may be interleaved; the output will appear in the order in which the calls are made.\n",

            "BART Summary: summarize: File CopyingGiven getchar and putchar, you can write a surprising amount of useful code without knowing anything more about input and output. The simplest example is a program that copies its input to its output one character at a time. The relational operator!= means ``not equal to''. The problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The type char is specifically meant for storing such character data, but any integer type can be used. The solution is that getchar returns a distinctive value when there is no more input, a value that cannot be confused with any real character. This value is called  grotesqueEOF, for 'end of file' The program for copying would be written more concisely by experienced C programmers. In C, any assignment is an expression and has a value, which is the value of the left hand side after the assignment. If the assignment of a character to c is put inside the test part of a while loop, the copy program can be written this way. The while gets a character, assigns it to c, and then tests whether the character was the end-of-file signal. If it is not, the body of the while is executed, printing the character. The while then repeats. When the end of the input is finally reached, the while terminates and so does main. The precedence of!= is higher than that of =. In the absence of parentheses the relational test!= would be done before the assignment =. This has the undesired effect of setting c to 0 or 1, depending on whether or not the call of getchar returned end end.\n",

The operators ++ and -- can be either prefix operators ( ++nc) or postfix operators (nc++) The character counting program accumulates its count in a long variable instead of an int. On some machines, int and long are the same size, on others an int is 16 bits, with a maximum value of 32767. We will also use a for statement instead of a while, to illustrate another way to write the loop. The body of this for loop is empty, because all the work is done in the test and increment parts. But the grammatical rules of C require that a for statement have a body. The isolated semicolon, called a null statement, is there to satisfy that requirement. We put it on a separate line to make it visible. summarize:  things about while and for is that they test at the top of the loop, before proceeding with the body. If there is nothing to do, nothing is done, even if that means never going through the loop body.Programs should act intelligently when given zero-length input.

            "BART Summary: The standard library ensures that an input text stream appears as a sequence of lines, each terminated by a newline. Counting lines is just counting newlines: #include <stdio.h> /* count lines in input */ main() { int c, nl; while ((c = getchar())!= EOF) if (c == '\\n') ++nl; printf(\"%d\\n\", nl); } A character written between single quotes represents an integer value equal to the numerical value of the character  in the machine's character set. This is called a character constant, although it is just another way to write a small  integer. A word of caution: newcomers to C occasionally write = when they mean ==. The result is usually a legal expression, so you will get no warning. Summarize:  independent of a particular character set. The escape sequences used in string constants are also legal in character constants, so '\\n' stands for the value of                 the newline character, which is 10 in ASCII. Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines. summarize: ercise 1-10.

            "BART Summary: Let is write a program to count the number of occurrences of each digit, of white space characters (blank, tab,  newline), and of all other characters. This is artificial, but it permits us to illustrate several aspects of C in one program. There are twelve categories of input, so it is convenient to use an array. Here is one version of the program:  #include <stdio.h> summarize:    while ((c = getchar())!= EOF) ++ndigit[c-'0']; ++nwhite; ++nother; printf(\"digits =\"); for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ndigit[i] = digits, white space = 123, other = 345. summarize: n, which includes integer variables like i, and integer constants. This particular program relies on the properties of the character representation of the digits. For example, the test  if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') determines whether the character in c is a digit. If it is, the numeric value of that digit is c - '0.' summarize: en 0 and 9 corresponding to the character '0' to '9' stored in c, and thus a valid subscript for the array ndigit. The decision as to whether a character is a digit, white space, or something else is made with the sequence. The switch statement provides another way to write a multi-way branch. It is suitable when the condition is whether some integer or character expression matches one of a set of                 constants. If none of the                 conditions is satisfied, the statement after the final else is executed if it is present. As a matter of style, it is advisable to format this construction as we have shown. Exercise 1-13. Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging. Exercises 1-14.

            "BART Summary: In C, a function is equivalent to a subroutine or function in Fortran. A function provides a convenient way to encapsulate some computation. With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore how a job is done. Since C has no exponentiation operator like the ** of Fortran, let us illustrate the mechanics of function definit. Summarize: ion by writing a function power(m,n) to raise an integer m to a positive integer power n. That is, the value of power(2,5) is 32. This function is not a practical exponentiation routine, since it handles only positive powers of small integers. summarize:   p = 1; for (i = 1, n = n; ++i) p = p * base;    return p; - p; --p; -n; -p; return p. C programming language is written in C, a programming language. Each call passes two arguments to power, which each time returns an integer to be formatted and printed. In an expression, power(2,i) is an integer just as 2 and i are. The names used by power for its parameters are local to power and are not visible to any other function. summarize: nerally use parameter for a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function. The value that power computes is returned to main by the return: statement. A return statement with no expression causes control, but no useful value, to be returned to the caller. The declaration just before main says that power is a function that expects two int arguments and returns an int. This declaration has to agree with the definition and uses of power. Non-zero values signal unusual or erroneous termination conditions. In the interests of simplicity, we have omitted return statements from our main functions up to this point. The biggest change between ANSI C and earlier versions is how functions are declared and defined. In the original definition of C, the power function would have been written like this:  /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */ (old-style version) The new syntax of function prototypes makes it much easier for a compiler to detect errors in the number of arguments or their types. The old style of declaration and definition s has been omitted. The new style of definition and declaration s is much easier to understand and understand. Summarize: till works in ANSI C, at least for a transition period. We strongly recommend that you use the new form when you have a compiler that supports it.

            "BART Summary: In C, all function arguments are passed ``by value'' This means that the called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables rather than the originals. This leads to more compact programs with fewer extraneous variables. Call by value is an asset, however, not a liability. The parameter n is used as a temporary variable, and is counted down (a for loop that runs backwards) until it becomes zero. Whatever is done to n inside power has no effect on the argument that power was originally called with. The caller must provide the address of the variable to be set (technically a pointer to the variable) and the called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer and access the va. The story is different for arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array. There is no copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any argument. This is the topic of the next section.\n",

            "BART Summary: The most common type of array in C is the array of characters. To illustrate the use of character arrays, let's write a program that reads a set of text lines and prints the longest. One piece gets a new line, another saves it, and the rest controls the process. When we find a line that is longer than the previous longest line, it must be saved somewhere. This suggests a  second function, copy, to copy the new line to a safe place. Here is a main program to control getline and copy. The result is a program that prints the longest line. Summarize: input line. If (max > 0) /* there was a line */ printf(\"%s\", longest); return 0;   } /* getline:  read a line into s, return length  */ int getline(char s[],int lim)   { for (i=0; i < lim-1 && (c=getchar())!=EOF) i; c; ++i; ++c; } The functions getline and copy are declared at the beginning of the program. They communicate through a pair of arguments and a returned value. In getline, the first argument is an array, and the second, lim, is an integer. The purpose of supplying the size of an array in a declaration is to set aside stor The length of an array s is not necessary in getline since its size is set in main. getline uses return to send a value back to the caller, just as the function power did. This line also declares that getline returns an int; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted. summarize: sed by the C language. When a string constant  like  \"hello\\n\"appears in a C program, it is stored as an array of characters containing the characters in the string and terminated with a '0' to mark the end. Main can determine whether the line was too long, and then cope as it wishes. There is no way for a user of getline to know in advance how long an input line might be, so getline checks for overflow. The user of copy already knows (or can find out) how big the strings are. Exercise 1-19. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s.

            "Topic: External Variables and Scope\n",
            "BART Summary: The variables in main, such as line, longest, etc., are private or local to main. Because they are declared within main, no other function can have direct access to them. This is why such variables are usually known as automatic variables, following terminology in other languages. We will use the term automatic henceforth to refer to these local variables. Because automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not retain their values from one call to the next. As an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are external to all functions. Because external variables are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to communicate data between functions. An external variable must be defined, exactly once, outside of any function. The variable must also be declared in each function that wants to access it. To make the discussion concrete, let us rewrite the longest-line program with line, longest, and max as external variables. This requires changing the calls, declarations, and bodies of all three functions. Summarize: so far */ char line[MAXLINE];    /* current input line */   char longest[MAXLine];  /* longest line saved here */  int getline(void); void copy( void); /* print longest input line; specialized version */ main() { int len; int max; extern char longest; return 0;   } The external variables in main, getline and copy are defined by the first lines of the example above. Syntactically, external definitions are just like definitions of local variables, but since they occur outside of functions, they are external. Before a function can use an external variable, the name of the variable must be made known to t. In certain circumstances, the extern declaration can be omitted. If the definition of the external variable occurs in the source file before its use in a particular function, then there is no need for a declaration in the function. The extern declarations in main, getline and copy are thus redundant. N declarations of variables and functions in a separate file, historically called a header, that is included by #include at the front of each source file. The functions of the standard library, for example, are declared in headers like <stdio.h>. This topic is discussed at length in Chapter 4, and the library itself in Chapter 7 and Appendix B. summarize: ration, and turns off all argument list checking; the word void must be used for an explicitly empty list. We will discuss this further in Chapter 4. You should note that we are using the words definition and declaration carefully when we refer to external variables. Summarize: aught with peril since it leads to programs whose data connections are not all obvious. Second version of the longest-line program is inferior to the first, partly for these reasons, and partly because it destroys the generality of two useful functions by writing into them the names of the variables they manipulate. summarize: e a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter? Exercise 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program.

            "BART Summary: The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages: Print the words hello, world. Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system, print the words \"hello, world\" C programs are written in the C programming language. To compile a C program, you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ``c'', such as hello.c. If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a character or misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently. The first line of the program, #include <stdio.h> tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library. The standard library is described in  ARTICLE 7 and Appendix B. One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values. summarize: nts, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list. In this example, main is defined to be a function that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list ( ). #include <stdio.h> includes information about standard library functions. The first C program contains only one statement, \"hello, world\\n\" The sequence \\n in the string is C notation for the newline character, w. A sequence of characters in double quotes is called a character string. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for printf and other functions. If you leave out the \\n (a worthwhile experiment), you will find that there is no line advance after the output is printed. You must use \\n to include a newline character in the printf argument. Several calls may be used to build up an output line. An escape sequence like \\n provides a general and extensib. C provides a mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. Among the others that C provides are \\t for tab, \\b for backspace, \\\" for the double quote and \\\\ for the backslash itself. There is a complete list in Section 2.3.\n",

            "BART Summary: The program itself still consists of the definition of a single function named main. It is longer than the one that printed ``hello, world'', but not complicated. It introduces several new ideas, including comments, variables, arithmetic expressions, loops, and formatted output. summarize:, upper, step; /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */ fahr = 0, 20,..., 300; step = 20; /* step size */ lower = 0; upper = 300; /* lower limit of temperature scale */ lower * (fahr-32) / 9; /* upper limit */ lower + step; lower + celsius; lower - celsius. The type int means that the variables listed are integers; by contrast with float, which means floating point. The range of both int and float depends on the machine you are using. 16-bits ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit ints. A float number is typically a 32- bit quantity, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10-38. summarize: float, including:  char   character - a single byte. There are also arrays, structures and unions of these basic types, pointers to them, and functions that return them. Individual statements are terminated by semicolons. The size of these objects is also machine-dependent. The while loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. If it is true, the body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces) is executed. When the test becomes false (fahr exceeds upper) the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows. In indentation and spacing are critical in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using blanks around operators to clarify grouping. The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently. summarize: celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;. The reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 is that in C, as in many other languages, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded. Since 5 and 9 are integers, 5/9 would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures would be reported as zero. summarize: %d\\t%d\\n\", fahr, celsius);.http://freebooks.by.ru/view/CProgrammingLanguage/ chapter1.html (6 of 30) Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction. There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is that the output isn't very pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if we augment each %d in the printf statement with a width, the numbers printed will be right- justified in their fields. summarize:  digits wide, and the second in a field six digits wide. Because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very accurate. To get more accurate answers, we should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer. This requires some changes in the program. This is much the same as before, except that fahr and celsius are declared to be float. We were unable to use 5/9 in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is floating point, so 5.0/9.0 is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values. summarize: nteger operation is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. If we had written (fahr-32), the 32 would be automatically converted tofloating point. %6.1f describes another number (celsius) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. width and precision may be omitted from a specification. %6d  print as decimal integer, at leas  20 characters wide. Among others, printf also recognizes %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, %c for character, %s for character                 string and %% for itself.summarize: t 6 characters wide                 %f  print as floating point                 %6.2f   print  floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point.\n",

The expression that computes the Celsius temperature now appears as the third argument of printf instead of a separate assignment statement. The for statement is a loop, a generalization of the while. Within the parentheses, there are three parts, separated by semicolons. The first part, the initialization, is done once, before the loop proper is entered. The second part is the test or condition that controls the The body of the loop can be a single statement or a group of statements enclosed in braces. The choice between while and for is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer. The for is usually appropriate in loops in which the initialization and increment are single statements and logically related. summarize: version program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.1.4. version of the program that prints the table is used to print it in the reverse order of the degree of the sun.\n",

Text input or output, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to, is dealt with as streams of characters. A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character. The function getchar reads the next input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. The function putchar prints a character each time it is called.

            "BART Summary: summarize: File CopyingGiven getchar and putchar, you can write a surprising amount of useful code without knowing anything more about input and output. The simplest example is a program that copies its input to its output one character at a time. The relational operator!= means ``not equal to''. The problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The type char is specifically meant for storing such character data, but any integer type can be used. The solution is that getchar returns a distinctive value when there is no more input, a value that cannot be confused with any real character. This value is called  grotesqueEOF, for 'end of file' The program for copying would be written more concisely by experienced C programmers. In C, any assignment is an expression and has a value, which is the value of the left hand side after the assignment. If the assignment of a character to c is put inside the test part of a while loop, the copy program can be written this way. The while gets a character, assigns it to c, and then tests whether the character was the end-of-file signal. If it is not, the body of the while is executed, printing the character. The while then repeats. When the end of the input is finally reached, the while terminates and so does main. The precedence of!= is higher than that of =. In the absence of parentheses the relational test!= would be done before the assignment =. This has the undesired effect of setting c to 0 or 1, depending on whether or not the call of getchar returned end end.\n",

The operators ++ and -- can be either prefix operators ( ++nc) or postfix operators (nc++) The character counting program accumulates its count in a long variable instead of an int. On some machines, int and long are the same size, on others an int is 16 bits, with a maximum value of 32767. We will also use a for statement instead of a while, to illustrate another way to write the loop. The body of this for loop is empty, because all the work is done in the test and increment parts. But the grammatical rules of C require that a for statement have a body. The isolated semicolon, called a null statement, is there to satisfy that requirement. We put it on a separate line to make it visible. summarize:  things about while and for is that they test at the top of the loop, before proceeding with the body.

            "BART Summary: Let is write a program to count the number of occurrences of each digit, of white space characters (blank, tab,  newline), and of all other characters. This is artificial, but it permits us to illustrate several aspects of C in one program. There are twelve categories of input, so it is convenient to use an array. Here is one version of the program:  #include <stdio.h> summarize:    while ((c = getchar())!= EOF) ++ndigit[c-'0']; ++nwhite; ++nother; printf(\"digits =\"); for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ndigit[i] = digits, white space = 123, other = 345. summarize: n, which includes integer variables like i, and integer constants. This particular program relies on the properties of the character representation of the digits. For example, the test  if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') determines whether the character in c is a digit. If it is, the numeric value of that digit is c - '0.' summarize: en 0 and 9 corresponding to the character '0' to '9' stored in c, and thus a valid subscript for the array ndigit. The decision as to whether a character is a digit, white space, or something else is made with the sequence. The switch statement provides another way to write a multi-way branch. It is suitable when the condition is whether some integer or character expression matches one of a set of                 constants.

            "BART Summary: In C, a function is equivalent to a subroutine or function in Fortran. A function provides a convenient way to encapsulate some computation. With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore how a job is done. Since C has no exponentiation operator like the ** of Fortran, let us illustrate the mechanics of function definit. Summarize: ion by writing a function power(m,n) to raise an integer m to a positive integer power n. That is, the value of power(2,5) is 32. This function is not a practical exponentiation routine, since it handles only positive powers of small integers. summarize:   p = 1; for (i = 1, n = n; ++i) p = p * base;    return p; - p; --p; -n; -p; return p. C programming language is written in C, a programming language. Each call passes two arguments to power, which each time returns an integer to be formatted and printed. In an expression, power(2,i) is an integer just as 2 and i are. The names used by power for its parameters are local to power and are not visible to any other function. summarize: nerally use parameter for a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function. The value that power computes is returned to main by the return: statement. A return statement with no expression causes control, but no useful value, to be returned to the caller. The declaration just before main says that power is a function that expects two int arguments and returns an int. This declaration has to agree with the definition and uses of power. Non-zero values signal unusual or erroneous termination conditions. In the interests of simplicity, we have omitted return statements from our main functions up to this point. The biggest change between ANSI C and earlier versions is how functions are declared and defined. In the original definition of C, the power function would have been written like this:  /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */ (old-style version) The new syntax of function prototypes makes it much easier for a compiler to detect errors in the number of arguments or their types. The old style of declaration and definition s has been omitted. The new style of definition and declaration s is much easier to understand and understand. Summarize: till works in ANSI C, at least for a transition period. We strongly recommend that you use the new form when you have a compiler that supports it.

            "BART Summary: In C, all function arguments are passed ``by value'' This means that the called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables rather than the originals. This leads to more compact programs with fewer extraneous variables. Call by value is an asset, however, not a liability. The parameter n is used as a temporary variable, and is counted down (a for loop that runs backwards) until it becomes zero. Whatever is done to n inside power has no effect on the argument that power was originally called with. The caller must provide the address of the variable to be set (technically a pointer to the variable) and the called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer and access the va. The story is different for arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array. There is no copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any argument. This is the topic of the next section.\n",

            "BART Summary: The most common type of array in C is the array of characters. To illustrate the use of character arrays, let's write a program that reads a set of text lines and prints the longest. One piece gets a new line, another saves it, and the rest controls the process. When we find a line that is longer than the previous longest line, it must be saved somewhere. This suggests a  second function, copy, to copy the new line to a safe place. Here is a main program to control getline and copy. The result is a program that prints the longest line. Summarize: input line. If (max > 0) /* there was a line */ printf(\"%s\", longest); return 0;   } /* getline:  read a line into s, return length  */ int getline(char s[],int lim)   { for (i=0; i < lim-1 && (c=getchar())!=EOF) i; c; ++i; ++c; } The functions getline and copy are declared at the beginning of the program. They communicate through a pair of arguments and a returned value. In getline, the first argument is an array, and the second, lim, is an integer. The purpose of supplying the size of an array in a declaration is to set aside stor The length of an array s is not necessary in getline since its size is set in main. getline uses return to send a value back to the caller, just as the function power did. This line also declares that getline returns an int; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted. summarize: sed by the C language. When a string constant  like  \"hello\\n\"appears in a C program, it is stored as an array of characters containing the characters in the string and terminated with a '0' to mark the end. Main can determine whether the line was too long, and then cope as it wishes. There is no way for a user of getline to know in advance how long an input line might be, so getline checks for overflow. The user of copy already knows (or can find out) how big the strings are. Exercise 1-19. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s.

            "Topic: External Variables and Scope\n",
            "BART Summary: The variables in main, such as line, longest, etc., are private or local to main. Because they are declared within main, no other function can have direct access to them. This is why such variables are usually known as automatic variables, following terminology in other languages. We will use the term automatic henceforth to refer to these local variables. Because automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not retain their values from one call to the next. As an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are external to all functions. Because external variables are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to communicate data between functions. An external variable must be defined, exactly once, outside of any function. The variable must also be declared in each function that wants to access it. To make the discussion concrete, let us rewrite the longest-line program with line, longest, and max as external variables. This requires changing the calls, declarations, and bodies of all three functions. Summarize: so far */ char line[MAXLINE];    /* current input line */   char longest[MAXLine];  /* longest line saved here */  int getline(void); void copy( void); /* print longest input line; specialized version */ main() { int len; int max; extern char longest; return 0;   } The external variables in main, getline and copy are defined by the first lines of the example above. Syntactically, external definitions are just like definitions of local variables, but since they occur outside of functions, they are external. Before a function can use an external variable, the name of the variable must be made known to t. In certain circumstances, the extern declaration can be omitted. If the definition of the external variable occurs in the source file before its use in a particular function, then there is no need for a declaration in the function. The extern declarations in main, getline and copy are thus redundant. N declarations of variables and functions in a separate file, historically called a header, that is included by #include at the front of each source file. The functions of the standard library, for example, are declared in headers like <stdio.h>. This topic is discussed at length in Chapter 4, and the library itself in Chapter 7 and Appendix B. summarize: ration, and turns off all argument list checking; the word void must be used for an explicitly empty list. We will discuss this further in Chapter 4. You should note that we are using the words definition and declaration carefully when we refer to external variables. Summarize: aught with peril since it leads to programs whose data connections are not all obvious. Second version of the longest-line program is inferior to the first, partly for these reasons, and partly because it destroys the generality of two useful functions by writing into them the names of the variables they manipulate. summarize: e a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop.

            "BART Summary: The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages: Print the words hello, world. Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system, print the words \"hello, world\" C programs are written in the C programming language. To compile a C program, you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ``c'', such as hello.c. If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a character or misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently. The first line of the program, #include <stdio.h> tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library. The standard library is described in  ARTICLE 7 and Appendix B. One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values. summarize: nts, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list. In this example, main is defined to be a function that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list ( ). #include <stdio.h> includes information about standard library functions. The first C program contains only one statement, \"hello, world\\n\" The sequence \\n in the string is C notation for the newline character, w. A sequence of characters in double quotes is called a character string. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for printf and other functions. If you leave out the \\n (a worthwhile experiment), you will find that there is no line advance after the output is printed. You must use \\n to include a newline character in the printf argument. Several calls may be used to build up an output line. An escape sequence like \\n provides a general and extensib. C provides a mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. Among the others that C provides are \\t for tab, \\b for backspace, \\\" for the double quote and \\\\ for the backslash itself. There is a complete list in Section 2.3.\n",

            "BART Summary: The program itself still consists of the definition of a single function named main. It is longer than the one that printed ``hello, world'', but not complicated. It introduces several new ideas, including comments, variables, arithmetic expressions, loops, and formatted output. summarize:, upper, step; /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */ fahr = 0, 20,..., 300; step = 20; /* step size */ lower = 0; upper = 300; /* lower limit of temperature scale */ lower * (fahr-32) / 9; /* upper limit */ lower + step; lower + celsius; lower - celsius. The type int means that the variables listed are integers; by contrast with float, which means floating point. The range of both int and float depends on the machine you are using. 16-bits ints, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit ints. A float number is typically a 32- bit quantity, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10-38. summarize: float, including:  char   character - a single byte. There are also arrays, structures and unions of these basic types, pointers to them, and functions that return them. Individual statements are terminated by semicolons. The size of these objects is also machine-dependent. The while loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. If it is true, the body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces) is executed. When the test becomes false (fahr exceeds upper) the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows. In indentation and spacing are critical in making programs easy for people to read. We recommend writing only one statement per line, and using blanks around operators to clarify grouping. The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently. summarize: celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;. The reason for multiplying by 5 and dividing by 9 is that in C, as in many other languages, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded. Since 5 and 9 are integers, 5/9 would be truncated to zero and so all the Celsius temperatures would be reported as zero. summarize: %d\\t%d\\n\", fahr, celsius);.http://freebooks.by.ru/view/CProgrammingLanguage/ chapter1.html (6 of 30) Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction. There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is that the output isn't very pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if we augment each %d in the printf statement with a width, the numbers printed will be right- justified in their fields. summarize:  digits wide, and the second in a field six digits wide. Because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very accurate. To get more accurate answers, we should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer. This requires some changes in the program. This is much the same as before, except that fahr and celsius are declared to be float. We were unable to use 5/9 in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is floating point, so 5.0/9.0 is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values. summarize: nteger operation is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. If we had written (fahr-32), the 32 would be automatically converted tofloating point. %6.1f describes another number (celsius) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. width and precision may be omitted from a specification. %6d  print as decimal integer, at leas  20 characters wide. Among others, printf also recognizes %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, %c for character, %s for character                 string and %% for itself.summarize: t 6 characters wide                 %f  print as floating point                 %6.2f   print  floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point.\n",

The expression that computes the Celsius temperature now appears as the third argument of printf instead of a separate assignment statement. The for statement is a loop, a generalization of the while. Within the parentheses, there are three parts, separated by semicolons. The first part, the initialization, is done once, before the loop proper is entered. The second part is the test or condition that controls the The body of the loop can be a single statement or a group of statements enclosed in braces. The choice between while and for is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer. The for is usually appropriate in loops in which the initialization and increment are single statements and logically related. summarize: version program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.1.4. version of the program that prints the table is used to print it in the reverse order of the degree of the sun.\n",

Text input or output, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to, is dealt with as streams of characters. A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character. The function getchar reads the next input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. The function putchar prints a character each time it is called. Calls to putchar and printf  may be interleaved; the output will appear in the order in which the calls are made.\n",

            "BART Summary: summarize: File CopyingGiven getchar and putchar, you can write a surprising amount of useful code without knowing anything more about input and output. The simplest example is a program that copies its input to its output one character at a time. The relational operator!= means ``not equal to''. The problem is distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The type char is specifically meant for storing such character data, but any integer type can be used. The solution is that getchar returns a distinctive value when there is no more input, a value that cannot be confused with any real character. This value is called  grotesqueEOF, for 'end of file' The program for copying would be written more concisely by experienced C programmers. In C, any assignment is an expression and has a value, which is the value of the left hand side after the assignment. If the assignment of a character to c is put inside the test part of a while loop, the copy program can be written this way. The while gets a character, assigns it to c, and then tests whether the character was the end-of-file signal. If it is not, the body of the while is executed, printing the character. The while then repeats. When the end of the input is finally reached, the while terminates and so does main. The precedence of!= is higher than that of =. In the absence of parentheses the relational test!= would be done before the assignment =. This has the undesired effect of setting c to 0 or 1, depending on whether or not the call of getchar returned end end.\n",

The operators ++ and -- can be either prefix operators ( ++nc) or postfix operators (nc++) The character counting program accumulates its count in a long variable instead of an int. On some machines, int and long are the same size, on others an int is 16 bits, with a maximum value of 32767. We will also use a for statement instead of a while, to illustrate another way to write the loop. The body of this for loop is empty, because all the work is done in the test and increment parts. But the grammatical rules of C require that a for statement have a body. The isolated semicolon, called a null statement, is there to satisfy that requirement. We put it on a separate line to make it visible. summarize:  things about while and for is that they test at the top of the loop, before proceeding with the body.

The result is usually a legal expression, so you will get no warning. Summarize:  independent of a particular character set.

            "BART Summary: Let is write a program to count the number of occurrences of each digit, of white space characters (blank, tab,  newline), and of all other characters. This is artificial, but it permits us to illustrate several aspects of C in one program. There are twelve categories of input, so it is convenient to use an array. Here is one version of the program:  #include <stdio.h> summarize:    while ((c = getchar())!= EOF) ++ndigit[c-'0']; ++nwhite; ++nother; printf(\"digits =\"); for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ndigit[i] = digits, white space = 123, other = 345. summarize: n, which includes integer variables like i, and integer constants. This particular program relies on the properties of the character representation of the digits. For example, the test  if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') determines whether the character in c is a digit. If it is, the numeric value of that digit is c - '0.' summarize: en 0 and 9 corresponding to the character '0' to '9' stored in c, and thus a valid subscript for the array ndigit. The decision as to whether a character is a digit, white space, or something else is made with the sequence. The switch statement provides another way to write a multi-way branch. It is suitable when the condition is whether some integer or character expression matches one of a set of                 constants. If none of the                 conditions is satisfied, the statement after the final else is executed if it is present.

            "BART Summary: In C, a function is equivalent to a subroutine or function in Fortran. A function provides a convenient way to encapsulate some computation. With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore how a job is done. Since C has no exponentiation operator like the ** of Fortran, let us illustrate the mechanics of function definit. Summarize: ion by writing a function power(m,n) to raise an integer m to a positive integer power n. That is, the value of power(2,5) is 32. This function is not a practical exponentiation routine, since it handles only positive powers of small integers. summarize:   p = 1; for (i = 1, n = n; ++i) p = p * base;    return p; - p; --p; -n; -p; return p. C programming language is written in C, a programming language. Each call passes two arguments to power, which each time returns an integer to be formatted and printed. In an expression, power(2,i) is an integer just as 2 and i are. The names used by power for its parameters are local to power and are not visible to any other function. summarize: nerally use parameter for a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function. The value that power computes is returned to main by the return: statement. A return statement with no expression causes control, but no useful value, to be returned to the caller. The declaration just before main says that power is a function that expects two int arguments and returns an int. This declaration has to agree with the definition and uses of power. Non-zero values signal unusual or erroneous termination conditions. In the interests of simplicity, we have omitted return statements from our main functions up to this point. The biggest change between ANSI C and earlier versions is how functions are declared and defined. In the original definition of C, the power function would have been written like this:  /* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */ (old-style version) The new syntax of function prototypes makes it much easier for a compiler to detect errors in the number of arguments or their types. The old style of declaration and definition s has been omitted. The new style of definition and declaration s is much easier to understand and understand. Summarize: till works in ANSI C, at least for a transition period. We strongly recommend that you use the new form when you have a compiler that supports it.

            "BART Summary: In C, all function arguments are passed ``by value'' This means that the called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables rather than the originals. This leads to more compact programs with fewer extraneous variables. Call by value is an asset, however, not a liability. The parameter n is used as a temporary variable, and is counted down (a for loop that runs backwards) until it becomes zero. Whatever is done to n inside power has no effect on the argument that power was originally called with. The caller must provide the address of the variable to be set (technically a pointer to the variable) and the called function must declare the parameter to be a pointer and access the va. The story is different for arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array. There is no copying of array elements. By subscripting this value, the function can access and alter any argument. This is the topic of the next section.\n",

            "BART Summary: The most common type of array in C is the array of characters. To illustrate the use of character arrays, let's write a program that reads a set of text lines and prints the longest. One piece gets a new line, another saves it, and the rest controls the process. When we find a line that is longer than the previous longest line, it must be saved somewhere. This suggests a  second function, copy, to copy the new line to a safe place. Here is a main program to control getline and copy. The result is a program that prints the longest line. Summarize: input line. If (max > 0) /* there was a line */ printf(\"%s\", longest); return 0;   } /* getline:  read a line into s, return length  */ int getline(char s[],int lim)   { for (i=0; i < lim-1 && (c=getchar())!=EOF) i; c; ++i; ++c; } The functions getline and copy are declared at the beginning of the program. They communicate through a pair of arguments and a returned value. In getline, the first argument is an array, and the second, lim, is an integer. The purpose of supplying the size of an array in a declaration is to set aside stor The length of an array s is not necessary in getline since its size is set in main. getline uses return to send a value back to the caller, just as the function power did. This line also declares that getline returns an int; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted. summarize: sed by the C language. When a string constant  like  \"hello\\n\"appears in a C program, it is stored as an array of characters containing the characters in the string and terminated with a '0' to mark the end. Main can determine whether the line was too long, and then cope as it wishes. There is no way for a user of getline to know in advance how long an input line might be, so getline checks for overflow. The user of copy already knows (or can find out) how big the strings are. Exercise 1-19. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s.

            "Topic: External Variables and Scope\n",
            "BART Summary: The variables in main, such as line, longest, etc., are private or local to main. Because they are declared within main, no other function can have direct access to them. This is why such variables are usually known as automatic variables, following terminology in other languages. We will use the term automatic henceforth to refer to these local variables. Because automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not retain their values from one call to the next. As an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are external to all functions. Because external variables are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to communicate data between functions. An external variable must be defined, exactly once, outside of any function. The variable must also be declared in each function that wants to access it. To make the discussion concrete, let us rewrite the longest-line program with line, longest, and max as external variables. This requires changing the calls, declarations, and bodies of all three functions. Summarize: so far */ char line[MAXLINE];    /* current input line */   char longest[MAXLine];  /* longest line saved here */  int getline(void); void copy( void); /* print longest input line; specialized version */ main() { int len; int max; extern char longest; return 0;   } The external variables in main, getline and copy are defined by the first lines of the example above. Syntactically, external definitions are just like definitions of local variables, but since they occur outside of functions, they are external. Before a function can use an external variable, the name of the variable must be made known to t. In certain circumstances, the extern declaration can be omitted. If the definition of the external variable occurs in the source file before its use in a particular function, then there is no need for a declaration in the function. The extern declarations in main, getline and copy are thus redundant. N declarations of variables and functions in a separate file, historically called a header, that is included by #include at the front of each source file. The functions of the standard library, for example, are declared in headers like <stdio.h>. This topic is discussed at length in Chapter 4, and the library itself in Chapter 7 and Appendix B. summarize: ration, and turns off all argument list checking; the word void must be used for an explicitly empty list. We will discuss this further in Chapter 4. You should note that we are using the words definition and declaration carefully when we refer to external variables. Summarize: aught with peril since it leads to programs whose data connections are not all obvious. Second version of the longest-line program is inferior to the first, partly for these reasons, and partly because it destroys the generality of two useful functions by writing into them the names of the variables they manipulate. summarize: e a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter? Exercise 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program.
